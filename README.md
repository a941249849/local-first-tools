> A curated list of tools and software that embrace the **local-first** philosophy: your data lives on your device, works offline by default, and syncs only when you choose.

## Why Local-First?

**Local-first** software keeps your data on your own hardware. The network is optional, not required. This means:

- **Privacy** -- Your data never has to leave your device. No third-party servers scanning your notes, files, or conversations.
- **Speed** -- No round-trips to a remote server. Everything loads instantly from local storage.
- **Ownership** -- You control your data. If a company shuts down, your files are still right where you left them.
- **Offline** -- Works on a plane, in a cabin, or anywhere without Wi-Fi. The internet is a feature, not a dependency.

This list collects the best tools that respect these principles -- from note-taking apps and office suites to encryption utilities and developer libraries.
